##### Android 16 and progress-centric notifications

Android 16 introduces progress-centric notifications to help users seamlessly track user-initiated,
start-to-end journeys. Key use cases include rideshare, delivery, and navigation.

This project is an example for a delivery app with the following order status: placed, accepted,
cooking, cooked, delivering, delivered.
